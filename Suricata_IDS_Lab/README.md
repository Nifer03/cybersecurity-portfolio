Suricata IDS/IPS Lab

This lab explores the installation, configuration, and testing of **Suricata**, an open-source IDS/IPS engine used for network traffic inspection. It demonstrates how to detect potential threats by analyzing packets in real time.

System Details
- Virtualization: Hyper-V
 
- OS:Kali GNU/Linux 2025.2
  
- Suricata Version: 7.0.10

What I Did
- Installed and Configured Suricata on a local Linux VM
  
- Configured custom rules to detect ICMP, HTTP, SSH, and suspicious DNS traffic

Planned Additions:

Integrate a basic GUI (Scirius CE) for better alert visualization

Use sample .pcap files to simulate attacks (e.g., port scans, brute force)

Capture logs and alerts in /var/log/suricata/
