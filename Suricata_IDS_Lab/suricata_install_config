sudo suricata-update list-sources

To add our source:
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/open

Let's update the Suricata in our instance to include the rule that we just added:
sudo suricata-update

Let's confirm our rules:
cd /var/lib/suricata
ls
ls -la

Let's update our root passwd first:
sudo passwd root

To become a root user, type:
su root

Type:
cd rules
ls -la

You should see two files classification.config and suricata.rules
Type:
cat suricata.rules

What you see now is the rules that Suricata will reference as it analyze network traffic. To quit
