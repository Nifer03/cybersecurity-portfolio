##Suricata Installation & Configuration

Here's a beginner-friendly Suricata Intrusion Detection System (IDS) setup for home lab practice and demonstration.

Environment:
Virtualization: Hyper-V
OS: Kali GNU/Linux 2025.2
Suricata Version: 7.0.10

Step 1: Update Kali packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Install Suricata
sudo apt install suricata -y

Step 3: Check version
suricata --build-info | grep version

Step 4: Check if itâ€™s running
sudo systemctl status suricata

Basic Configuration
Set HOME_NET in Suricata YAML config
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Find the section:
vars:
  address-groups:
    HOME_NET: "[192.168.0.0/16]"
Your HOME_NET is your VM's internal IP address range. To find your HOME_NET run 
ip a

Set your interface
Ctrl + W

Then type:
interface

Edit and update it according to the interface you want to monitor.

Rules
sudo suricata-update list-sources

To add our source:
sudo suricata-update enable-source et/open

Let's update the Suricata in our instance to include the rule that we just added:
sudo suricata-update

Let's confirm our rules:
cd /var/lib/suricata
ls
ls -la

Let's update our root passwd first:
sudo passwd root

To become a root user, type:
su root

Type:
cd rules
ls -la

You should see two files classification.config and suricata.rules
Type:
cat suricata.rules

What you see now are the rules that Suricata will reference as it analyze network traffic. To quit
CTRL Q 

Let's start testing our Suricata
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v

You should see "Configuration provided was successfully loaded."

Now let's run Suricata by starting its service:
sudo systemctl start suricata.service
sudo systemctl status suricata.service

Let's check if our Suricata is working
cd /var/log/suricata
ls
cat fast.log
curl http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html

This should generate an alert. Let's check:
cat fast.log

You should get something like this:[Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic]

Now let's check our eve.json file:
cat eve.json

You can see more details here compared to fast.log. 

Now our Suricata is up and running.
