Hi, I'm Jen. I have 13 years of experience in sales across the tech, finance, healthcare, and real estate industries. With a strong foundation in communication, problem solving, customer service and client engagement, I’m expanding my skill set to include cybersecurity, focusing on threat detection, cloud security, and infrastructure protection.

I’ve recently earned my CompTIA Security+ certification, and I’ve been applying what I’ve learned through hands-on labs and real-world simulations.
